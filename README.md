# ABOUT
This is my WIP repository for the Nand2Tetris part 2 course on Coursera. The JackAnalyzer takes source code and creates an XML file containing an AST for any given Jack source file.

As of Jan 2023 it is incomplete, and the XML file only contains terminal symbols - keywords, symbols, and identifiers.
